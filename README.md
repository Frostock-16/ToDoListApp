# About the project
This is my second Android app project and my first fully functional app integrated with Firebase. It took a considerable amount of time to build, as I was actively learning Android development throughout the process. A significant portion of the time was spent on designing the UI â€” I initially started with the AppCompat design but later transitioned to Google's newer Material3 design system. This shift required a complete redesign of the app to align with modern Android UI standards.

While the app itself is relatively simple, it successfully implements all the core features expected from a To-Do list app, making it a solid foundation for future improvements.
